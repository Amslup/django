Freedom 1.0.2 release notes
==========================

Welcome to Freedom 1.0.2!

This is the second "bugfix" release in the Freedom 1.0 series,
improving the stability and performance of the Freedom 1.0 codebase. As
such, Freedom 1.0.2 contains no new features (and, pursuant to
:doc:`our compatibility policy </misc/api-stability>`, maintains backwards compatibility with Freedom
1.0.0), but does contain a number of fixes and other
improvements. Freedom 1.0.2 is a recommended upgrade for any
development or deployment currently using or targeting Freedom 1.0.


Fixes and improvements in Freedom 1.0.2
======================================

The primary reason behind this release is to remedy an issue in the
recently-released Freedom 1.0.1; the packaging scripts used for Freedom
1.0.1 omitted some directories from the final release package,
including one directory required by ``freedom.contrib.gis`` and part of
Freedom's unit-test suite.

Freedom 1.0.2 contains updated packaging scripts, and the release
package contains the directories omitted from Freedom 1.0.1. As such,
this release contains all of the fixes and improvements from Freedom
1.0.1; see :doc:`the Freedom 1.0.1 release notes </releases/1.0.1>` for
details.

Additionally, in the period since Freedom 1.0.1 was released:

* Updated Hebrew and Danish translations have been added.

* The default ``__repr__`` method of Freedom models has been made more
  robust in the face of bad Unicode data coming from the
  ``__unicode__`` method; rather than raise an exception in such
  cases, ``repr()`` will now contain the string "[Bad Unicode data]"
  in place of the invalid Unicode.

* A bug involving the interaction of Freedom's ``SafeUnicode`` class
  and the MySQL adapter has been resolved; ``SafeUnicode`` instances
  (generated, for example, by template rendering) can now be assigned
  to model attributes and saved to MySQL without requiring an explicit
  intermediate cast to ``unicode``.

* A bug affecting filtering on a nullable ``DateField`` in SQLite has
  been resolved.

* Several updates and improvements have been made to Freedom's
  documentation.
