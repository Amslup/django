Django 1.11.29.1 security fixes

CVE-2021-31542: Potential directory-traversal via uploaded files
================================================================

``MultiPartParser``, ``UploadedFile``, and ``FieldFile`` allowed
directory-traversal via uploaded files with suitably crafted file names.

In order to mitigate this risk, stricter basename and path sanitation is now
applied. Specifically, empty file names and paths with dot segments will be
rejected.


CVE-2021-33203: Potential directory traversal via ``admindocs``
===============================================================

Staff members could use the :mod:`~django.contrib.admindocs`
``TemplateDetailView`` view to check the existence of arbitrary files.
Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been
customized by the developers to also expose the file contents, then not only
the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed.

As a mitigation, path sanitation is now applied and only files within the
template root directories can be loaded.

using a suitably crafted ``tolerance``.
