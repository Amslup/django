Django 1.7.3 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.7.3 fixes several bugs in 1.7.2 and adds minor updates.



Bugfixes
========

* The default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher has been
  increased by 25%. This part of the normal major release process was
  inadvertently omitted in 1.7. This backwards compatible change will not
  affect users who have subclassed
  ``django.contrib.auth.hashers.PBKDF2PasswordHasher`` to change the
  default value.

* Fixed a crash in the CSRF middleware when handling non-ASCII referer header
  (:ticket:`23815`).



Minor updates
=============

* Changed numeration behaviour in makemigrations after squashing
  (:ticket:`23953`).
  Now migrations numeration goes after the latest existing migration
  instead of the squashed one.
