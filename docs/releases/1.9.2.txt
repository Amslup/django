Django 1.9.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

Django 1.9.2 fixes several bugs in 1.9.1 and makes a small backwards
incompatible change described in the next section.

``.py-tpl`` suffix added to project/app Python templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The addition of some Django template language syntax to the default app
template in Django 1.9 means those files now have some invalid Python syntax.
This causes difficulties for packaging systems that unconditionally
byte-compile ``*.py`` files.

To remedy this, a ``.py-tpl`` suffix was used to all project and app template
files. The resulting ``.py-tpl`` suffix is replaced with ``.py`` by the
``startproject`` and ``startapp`` commands. For example, a template with the
filename ``manage.py-tpl`` will be created as ``manage.py``.

Bugfixes
========

* Fixed a regression in ``ConditionalGetMiddleware`` causing ``If-None-Match``
  checks to always return HTTP 200 (:ticket:`26024`).

* Fixed a regression that caused the "user-tools" items to display on the
  admin's logout page (:ticket:`26035`).

* Fixed a crash in the translations system when the current language has no
  translations (:ticket:`26046`).

* Fixed a regression that caused the incorrect day to be selected when opening
  the admin calendar widget for timezones from GMT+0100 to GMT+1200
  (:ticket:`24980`).
