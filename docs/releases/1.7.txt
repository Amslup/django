Django 1.7 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
============================================

Welcome to Django 1.7!

These release notes cover the `new features`_, as well as some `backwards
incompatible changes`_ you'll want to be aware of when upgrading from Django
1.6 or older versions. We've also dropped some features, which are detailed in
:doc:`our deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>`, and we've `begun the
deprecation process for some features`_.

.. _`new features`: `What's new in Django 1.7`_
.. _`backwards incompatible changes`: `Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7`_
.. _`begun the deprecation process for some features`: `Features deprecated in 1.7`_

What's new in Django 1.7
========================

Backwards incompatible changes in 1.7
=====================================

.. warning::

    In addition to the changes outlined in this section, be sure to review the
    :doc:`deprecation plan </internals/deprecation>` for any features that
    have been removed. If you haven't updated your code within the
    deprecation timeline for a given feature, its removal may appear as a
    backwards incompatible change.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The admin "today" and "now" shortcuts next to date and time input widgets are
  now operating in the current time zone on the backend. They previously used
  the browser time zone which could yield unpredictable outcome because the value
  is interpreted by the backend in its own time zone. The widgets will display
  a help message when the backend and browser time zone are different.

Features deprecated in 1.7
==========================

``django.utils.dictconfig``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.dictconfig`` was a copy of :mod:`logging.config` provided for
Python versions prior to 2.7. It has been deprecated.

``django.utils.unittest``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``django.utils.unittest`` provided uniform access to the ``unittest2`` library
on all Python versions. Since ``unittest2`` became the standard library's
:mod:`unittest` module in Python 2.7, and Django 1.7 drops support for older
Python versions, this module isn't useful anymore. It has been deprecated. Use
:mod:`unittest` instead.
