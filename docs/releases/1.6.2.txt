Django 1.6.2 release notes
==========================

*Under development*

This is Django 1.6.2, a bugfix release for Django 1.6.

Bug fixes
=========

* Prevented the base geometry object of a prepared geometry to be garbage
  collected, which could lead to crash Django (#21662).

* Fixed a crash when executing the :djadmin:`changepassword` command when the
  user object representation contained non-ASCII characters (#21627).

* Fixed the :djadmin:`collectstatic` command to no longer default to the current
  working directory when :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` is not set. Combined with the
  ``--clear`` option, the previous behavior could be quite dangerous and wipe
  anything below the current working directory.
