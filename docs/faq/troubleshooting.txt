What if it doesn't work?  What did I not do?

django-admin.py errors
----------------------

:doc:`django-admin.py </ref/django-admin>` should be on your system path if you
installed Django via ``python setup.py``. If it's not on your path, you can find
it in ``site-packages/django/bin``, where ``site-packages`` is a directory
within your Python installation. Consider symlinking to :doc:`django-admin.py
</ref/django-admin>` from some place on your path, such as
:file:`/usr/local/bin`.
