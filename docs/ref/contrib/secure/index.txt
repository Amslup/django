Django's security configuration and checks
==========================================

.. module:: django.contrib.security
   :synopsis: Django's security configuration and checks.

``django.contrib.secure`` does not make your site secure. It does not audit
code, or do intrusion detection, or really do anything particularly interesting
or complicated. Rather, it's an automated low-hanging-fruit checklist. It helps
you remember the stupid simple things that improve your site's security, reminds
you to do those easy things, and makes them as easy as possible to do.
