Form wizard
===========

Historically, Django shipped with ``django.contrib.formtools`` -- a collection
of assorted utilities that are useful for specific form use cases. This code is
now distributed separately from Django, for easier maintenance and to trim the
size of Django's codebase.

The new formtools package is named ``django-formtools``, with a main module
called ``formtools``. Version 1.0 includes the same two primary features that
the code included when it shipped with Django: a helper for form previews and a
form wizard view.
