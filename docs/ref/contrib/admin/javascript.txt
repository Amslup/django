JavaScript customizations in the admin

Inline hooks

.. versionadded:: 1.9

You may want to execute some JavaScript when an inline form is added or removed
in the admin change form. The ``formset:added`` and ``formset:removed`` jQuery
events allow this. The event handler is passed three arguments:

* ``event`` is the ``jQuery`` event.
* ``$row`` is the newly added (or removed) row.
* ``formsetName`` is the formset the row belongs to.

The event is fired using the ``django.jQuery`` namespace. See
:ref:`contrib-admin-jquery` for information.

In your custom ``change_form.html`` template, extend the
``admin_change_form_document_ready`` block and add the event listener code:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends 'admin/change_form.html' %}

    {% block admin_change_form_document_ready %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <script type="text/javascript">
    (function($) {
        $(document).on('formset:added', function(event, $row, formsetName) {
            if (formsetName == 'author_set') {
                // Do something
            } else {
                // Do something else;
            }
        });

        $(document).on('formset:removed', function(event, $row, formsetName) {
            // Row removed
        });
    })(django.jQuery);
    </script>
    {% endblock %}

Two points to keep in mind:

* The JavaScript code must go in a block if you are inheriting
  ``admin/change_form.html`` or it won't be rendered in the final HTML.
* ``{{ block.super }}`` is added because Django's
  ``admin_change_form_document_ready`` block contains JavaScript code to handle
  various operations in the change form and we need that to be rendered too.

Sometimes you'll need to work with ``jQuery`` plugins that are not registered
in the ``django.jQuery`` namespace. To do that, simply change how the code
listens for events. Instead of wrapping the listener in the ``django.jQuery``
namespace, just listen to the event triggered from there. For example:

.. code-block:: html+django

    {% extends 'admin/change_form.html' %}

    {% block admin_change_form_document_ready %}
    {{ block.super }}
    <script type="text/javascript">
        django.jQuery(document).on('formset:added', function(event, $row, formsetName) {
            // Row added
        });

        django.jQuery(document).on('formset:removed', function(event, $row, formsetName) {
            // Row removed
        });
    </script>
    {% endblock %}
