============
Object Tools
============

.. currentmodule:: django.contrib.admin

Certain actions apply directly to a model but not individual models or
collections of models. These appear in a "toolbar" row above the form or
changelist, to the right of the page. These buttons are called object tools.

Example from a changelist page:

.. image:: _images/objecttools_01.png
   :alt: Object tools on a changelist page

and from a form page:

.. image:: _images/objecttools_02.png
   :alt: Object tools on a form page

In the change list object tools are very similar to :doc:`Admin actions
<actions>` but are intended to be used for creation of objects or manipulations
that don't require individual model objects or querysets.

Writing object tools
====================
Object tools are just Django views that get automatically added to the admin
routes for a model. One common use case for an object tool is the add model
button.
