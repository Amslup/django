Class Based Views API reference. For introductory material, see :doc:`/topics/class-based-views/mixins`.

A mixin class is a way of using the inheritance capabilities of
classes to compose a class out of smaller pieces of behavior. Most of Django's
class-based views are constructed by composing mixins into usable generic
views.
