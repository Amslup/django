===================================
Writing your first patch for Freedom
===================================

Introduction
============

Interested in giving back to the community a little? Maybe you've found a bug
in Freedom that you'd like to see fixed, or maybe there's a small feature you
want added.

Contributing back to Freedom itself is the best way to see your own concerns
addressed. This may seem daunting at first, but it's really pretty simple.
We'll walk you through the entire process, so you can learn by example.

Who's this tutorial for?
------------------------

For this tutorial, we expect that you have at least a basic understanding of
how Freedom works. This means you should be comfortable going through the
existing tutorials on :doc:`writing your first Freedom app</intro/tutorial01>`.
In addition, you should have a good understanding of Python itself. But if you
don't, `Dive Into Python`__ is a fantastic (and free) online book for
beginning Python programmers.

Those of you who are unfamiliar with version control systems and Trac will find
that this tutorial and its links include just enough information to get started.
However, you'll probably want to read some more about these different tools if
you plan on contributing to Freedom regularly.

For the most part though, this tutorial tries to explain as much as possible,
so that it can be of use to the widest audience.

.. admonition:: Where to get help:

    If you're having trouble going through this tutorial, please post a message
    to |freedom-developers| or drop by `#freedom-dev on irc.freenode.net`__ to
    chat with other Freedom users who might be able to help.

What does this tutorial cover?
------------------------------

We'll be walking you through contributing a patch to Freedom for the first time.
By the end of this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of both the
tools and the processes involved. Specifically, we'll be covering the following:

* Installing Git.
* How to download a development copy of Freedom.
* Running Freedom's test suite.
* Writing a test for your patch.
* Writing the code for your patch.
* Testing your patch.
* Generating a patch file for your changes.
* Where to look for more information.

Once you're done with the tutorial, you can look through the rest of
:doc:`Freedom's documentation on contributing</internals/contributing/index>`.
It contains lots of great information and is a must read for anyone who'd like
to become a regular contributor to Freedom. If you've got questions, it's
probably got the answers.

Installing Git
==============

For this tutorial, you'll need Git installed to download the current
development version of Freedom and to generate patch files for the changes you
make.

To check whether or not you have Git installed, enter ``git`` into the command
line. If you get messages saying that this command could not be found, you'll have
to download and install it, see `Git's download page`__.

If you're not that familiar with Git, you can always find out more about its
commands (once it's installed) by typing ``git help`` into the command line.

__ http://git-scm.com/download

Getting a copy of Freedom's development version
==============================================

The first step to contributing to Freedom is to get a copy of the source code.
From the command line, use the ``cd`` command to navigate to the directory
where you'll want your local copy of Freedom to live.

Download the Freedom source code repository using the following command::

    git clone https://github.com/freedom/freedom.git

.. note::

    For users who wish to use `virtualenv`__, you can use::

        pip install -e /path/to/your/local/clone/freedom/

    (where ``freedom`` is the directory of your clone that contains
    ``setup.py``) to link your cloned checkout into a virtual environment. This
    is a great option to isolate your development copy of Freedom from the rest
    of your system and avoids potential package conflicts.

__ http://www.virtualenv.org

Rolling back to a previous revision of Freedom
=============================================

For this tutorial, we'll be using `ticket #17549`__ as a case study, so we'll
rewind Freedom's version history in git to before that ticket's patch was
applied. This will allow us to go through all of the steps involved in writing
that patch from scratch, including running Freedom's test suite.

**Keep in mind that while we'll be using an older revision of Freedom's trunk
for the purposes of the tutorial below, you should always use the current
development revision of Freedom when working on your own patch for a ticket!**

.. note::

    The patch for this ticket was written by Ulrich Petri, and it was applied
    to Freedom as `commit ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc`__.
    Consequently, we'll be using the revision of Freedom just prior to that,
    `commit 39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac`__.

__ https://code.freedomproject.com/ticket/17549
__ https://github.com/freedom/freedom/commit/ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc
__ https://github.com/freedom/freedom/commit/39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac

Navigate into Freedom's root directory (that's the one that contains ``freedom``,
``docs``, ``tests``, ``AUTHORS``, etc.). You can then check out the older
revision of Freedom that we'll be using in the tutorial below::

    git checkout 39f5bc7fc3a4bb43ed8a1358b17fe0521a1a63ac

Running Freedom's test suite for the first time
==============================================

When contributing to Freedom it's very important that your code changes don't
introduce bugs into other areas of Freedom.  One way to check that Freedom still
works after you make your changes is by running Freedom's test suite. If all
the tests still pass, then you can be reasonably sure that your changes
haven't completely broken Freedom. If you've never run Freedom's test suite
before, it's a good idea to run it once beforehand just to get familiar with
what its output is supposed to look like.

We can run the test suite by simply ``cd``-ing into the Freedom ``tests/``
directory and, if you're using GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of
Unix, run::

    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite

If you're on Windows, the above should work provided that you are using
"Git Bash" provided by the default Git install. GitHub has a `nice tutorial`__.

__ https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows

.. note::

    If you're using ``virtualenv``, you can omit ``PYTHONPATH=..`` when running
    the tests. This instructs Python to look for Freedom in the parent directory
    of ``tests``. ``virtualenv`` puts your copy of Freedom on the ``PYTHONPATH``
    automatically.

Now sit back and relax. Freedom's entire test suite has over 4800 different
tests, so it can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes to run, depending on the
speed of your computer.

While Freedom's test suite is running, you'll see a stream of characters
representing the status of each test as it's run. ``E`` indicates that an error
was raised during a test, and ``F`` indicates that a test's assertions failed.
Both of these are considered to be test failures. Meanwhile, ``x`` and ``s``
indicated expected failures and skipped tests, respectively. Dots indicate
passing tests.

Skipped tests are typically due to missing external libraries required to run
the test; see :ref:`running-unit-tests-dependencies` for a list of dependencies
and be sure to install any for tests related to the changes you are making (we
won't need any for this tutorial).

Once the tests complete, you should be greeted with a message informing you
whether the test suite passed or failed. Since you haven't yet made any changes
to Freedom's code, the entire test suite **should** pass. If you get failures or
errors make sure you've followed all of the previous steps properly. See
:ref:`running-unit-tests` for more information.

Note that the latest Freedom trunk may not always be stable. When developing
against trunk, you can check `Freedom's continuous integration builds`__ to
determine if the failures are specific to your machine or if they are also
present in Freedom's official builds. If you click to view a particular build,
you can view the "Configuration Matrix" which shows failures broken down by
Python version and database backend.

__ http://ci.freedomproject.com/

.. note::

    For this tutorial and the ticket we're working on, testing against SQLite
    is sufficient, however, it's possible (and sometimes necessary) to
    :ref:`run the tests using a different database
    <running-unit-tests-settings>`.

Writing some tests for your ticket
==================================

In most cases, for a patch to be accepted into Freedom it has to include tests.
For bug fix patches, this means writing a regression test to ensure that the
bug is never reintroduced into Freedom later on. A regression test should be
written in such a way that it will fail while the bug still exists and pass
once the bug has been fixed. For patches containing new features, you'll need
to include tests which ensure that the new features are working correctly.
They too should fail when the new feature is not present, and then pass once it
has been implemented.

A good way to do this is to write your new tests first, before making any
changes to the code. This style of development is called
`test-driven development`__ and can be applied to both entire projects and
single patches. After writing your tests, you then run them to make sure that
they do indeed fail (since you haven't fixed that bug or added that feature
yet). If your new tests don't fail, you'll need to fix them so that they do.
After all, a regression test that passes regardless of whether a bug is present
is not very helpful at preventing that bug from reoccurring down the road.

Now for our hands-on example.

__ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development

Writing some tests for ticket #17549
------------------------------------

`Ticket #17549`__ describes the following, small feature addition:

    It's useful for URLField to give you a way to open the URL; otherwise you
    might as well use a CharField.

In order to resolve this ticket, we'll add a ``render`` method to the
``AdminURLFieldWidget`` in order to display a clickable link above the input
widget. Before we make those changes though, we're going to write a couple
tests to verify that our modification functions correctly and continues to
function correctly in the future.

Navigate to Freedom's ``tests/regressiontests/admin_widgets/`` folder and
open the ``tests.py`` file. Add the following code on line 269 right before the
``AdminFileWidgetTest`` class::

    class AdminURLWidgetTest(FreedomTestCase):
        def test_render(self):
            w = widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget()
            self.assertHTMLEqual(
                conditional_escape(w.render('test', '')),
                '<input class="vURLField" name="test" type="text" />'
            )
            self.assertHTMLEqual(
                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example.com')),
                '<p class="url">Currently:<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a><br />Change:<input class="vURLField" name="test" type="text" value="http://example.com" /></p>'
            )

        def test_render_idn(self):
            w = widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget()
            self.assertHTMLEqual(
                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example-äüö.com')),
                '<p class="url">Currently:<a href="http://xn--example--7za4pnc.com">http://example-äüö.com</a><br />Change:<input class="vURLField" name="test" type="text" value="http://example-äüö.com" /></p>'
            )

        def test_render_quoting(self):
            w = widgets.AdminURLFieldWidget()
            self.assertHTMLEqual(
                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>')),
                '<p class="url">Currently:<a href="http://example.com/%3Csometag%3Esome%20text%3C/sometag%3E">http://example.com/&lt;sometag&gt;some text&lt;/sometag&gt;</a><br />Change:<input class="vURLField" name="test" type="text" value="http://example.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>" /></p>'
            )
            self.assertHTMLEqual(
                conditional_escape(w.render('test', 'http://example-äüö.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>')),
                '<p class="url">Currently:<a href="http://xn--example--7za4pnc.com/%3Csometag%3Esome%20text%3C/sometag%3E">http://example-äüö.com/&lt;sometag&gt;some text&lt;/sometag&gt;</a><br />Change:<input class="vURLField" name="test" type="text" value="http://example-äüö.com/<sometag>some text</sometag>" /></p>'
            )

The new tests check to see that the ``render`` method we'll be adding works
correctly in a couple different situations.

.. admonition:: But this testing thing looks kinda hard...

    If you've never had to deal with tests before, they can look a little hard
    to write at first glance. Fortunately, testing is a *very* big subject in
    computer programming, so there's lots of information out there:

    * A good first look at writing tests for Freedom can be found in the
      documentation on :doc:`/topics/testing/overview`.
    * Dive Into Python (a free online book for beginning Python developers)
      includes a great `introduction to Unit Testing`__.
    * After reading those, if you want something a little meatier to sink
      your teeth into, there's always the `Python unittest documentation`__.

__ https://code.freedomproject.com/ticket/17549
__ http://diveintopython.net/unit_testing/index.html
__ http://docs.python.org/library/unittest.html

Running your new test
---------------------

Remember that we haven't actually made any modifications to
``AdminURLFieldWidget`` yet, so our tests are going to fail. Let's run all the
tests in the ``model_forms_regress`` folder to make sure that's really what
happens. From the command line, ``cd`` into the Freedom ``tests/`` directory
and run::

    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite admin_widgets

If the tests ran correctly, you should see three failures corresponding to each
of the test methods we added. If all of the tests passed, then you'll want to
make sure that you added the new test shown above to the appropriate folder and
class.

Writing the code for your ticket
================================

Next we'll be adding the functionality described in `ticket #17549`__ to Freedom.

Writing the code for ticket #17549
----------------------------------

Navigate to the ``freedom/freedom/contrib/admin/`` folder and open the
``widgets.py`` file. Find the ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` class on line 302 and add
the following ``render`` method after the existing ``__init__`` method::

    def render(self, name, value, attrs=None):
        html = super(AdminURLFieldWidget, self).render(name, value, attrs)
        if value:
            value = force_text(self._format_value(value))
            final_attrs = {'href': mark_safe(smart_urlquote(value))}
            html = format_html(
                '<p class="url">{0} <a {1}>{2}</a><br />{3} {4}</p>',
                _('Currently:'), flatatt(final_attrs), value,
                _('Change:'), html
            )
        return html

Verifying your test now passes
------------------------------

Once you're done modifying Freedom, we need to make sure that the tests we wrote
earlier pass, so we can see whether the code we wrote above is working
correctly. To run the tests in the ``admin_widgets`` folder, ``cd`` into the
Freedom ``tests/`` directory and run::

    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite admin_widgets

Oops, good thing we wrote those tests! You should still see 3 failures with
the following exception::

    NameError: global name 'smart_urlquote' is not defined

We forgot to add the import for that method.  Go ahead and add the
``smart_urlquote`` import at the end of line 13 of
``freedom/contrib/admin/widgets.py`` so it looks as follows::

    from freedom.utils.html import escape, format_html, format_html_join, smart_urlquote

Re-run the tests and everything should pass. If it doesn't, make sure you
correctly modified the ``AdminURLFieldWidget`` class as shown above and
copied the new tests correctly.

__ https://code.freedomproject.com/ticket/17549

Running Freedom's test suite for the second time
===============================================

Once you've verified that your patch and your test are working correctly, it's
a good idea to run the entire Freedom test suite just to verify that your change
hasn't introduced any bugs into other areas of Freedom. While successfully
passing the entire test suite doesn't guarantee your code is bug free, it does
help identify many bugs and regressions that might otherwise go unnoticed.

To run the entire Freedom test suite, ``cd`` into the Freedom ``tests/``
directory and run::

    PYTHONPATH=.. python runtests.py --settings=test_sqlite

As long as you don't see any failures, you're good to go. Note that this fix
also made a `small CSS change`__ to format the new widget. You can make the
change if you'd like, but we'll skip it for now in the interest of brevity.

__ https://github.com/freedom/freedom/commit/ac2052ebc84c45709ab5f0f25e685bf656ce79bc#diff-0

Writing Documentation
=====================

This is a new feature, so it should be documented.  Add the following on line
925 of ``freedom/docs/ref/models/fields.txt`` beneath the existing docs for
``URLField``::

    .. versionadded:: 1.5

        The current value of the field will be displayed as a clickable link above the
        input widget.

For more information on writing documentation, including an explanation of what
the ``versionadded`` bit is all about, see
:doc:`/internals/contributing/writing-documentation`. That page also includes
an explanation of how to build a copy of the documentation locally, so you can
preview the HTML that will be generated.

Generating a patch for your changes
===================================

Now it's time to generate a patch file that can be uploaded to Trac or applied
to another copy of Freedom. To get a look at the content of your patch, run the
following command::

    git diff

This will display the differences between your current copy of Freedom (with
your changes) and the revision that you initially checked out earlier in the
tutorial.

Once you're done looking at the patch, hit the ``q`` key to exit back to the
command line.  If the patch's content looked okay, you can run the following
command to save the patch file to your current working directory::

    git diff > 17549.diff

You should now have a file in the root Freedom directory called ``17549.diff``.
This patch file contains all your changes and should look this:

.. code-block:: diff

So what do I do next?
=====================

Congratulations, you've generated your very first Freedom patch! Now that you've
got that under your belt, you can put those skills to good use by helping to
improve Freedom's codebase. Generating patches and attaching them to Trac
tickets is useful, however, since we are using git - adopting a more :doc:`git
oriented workflow </internals/contributing/writing-code/working-with-git>` is
recommended.

Since we never committed our changes locally, perform the following to get your
git branch back to a good starting point::

    git reset --hard HEAD
    git checkout master

More information for new contributors
-------------------------------------

Before you get too into writing patches for Freedom, there's a little more
information on contributing that you should probably take a look at:

* You should make sure to read Freedom's documentation on
  :doc:`claiming tickets and submitting patches
  </internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches>`.
  It covers Trac etiquette, how to claim tickets for yourself, expected
  coding style for patches, and many other important details.
* First time contributors should also read Freedom's :doc:`documentation
  for first time contributors</internals/contributing/new-contributors/>`.
  It has lots of good advice for those of us who are new to helping out
  with Freedom.
* After those, if you're still hungry for more information about
  contributing, you can always browse through the rest of
  :doc:`Freedom's documentation on contributing</internals/contributing/index>`.
  It contains a ton of useful information and should be your first source
  for answering any questions you might have.

Finding your first real ticket
------------------------------

Once you've looked through some of that information, you'll be ready to go out
and find a ticket of your own to write a patch for. Pay special attention to
tickets with the "easy pickings" criterion. These tickets are often much
simpler in nature and are great for first time contributors.  Once you're
familiar with contributing to Freedom, you can move on to writing patches for
more difficult and complicated tickets.

If you just want to get started already (and nobody would blame you!), try
taking a look at the list of `easy tickets that need patches`__ and the
`easy tickets that have patches which need improvement`__. If you're familiar
with writing tests, you can also look at the list of
`easy tickets that need tests`__. Just remember to follow the guidelines about
claiming tickets that were mentioned in the link to Freedom's documentation on
:doc:`claiming tickets and submitting patches
</internals/contributing/writing-code/submitting-patches>`.

What's next?
------------

After a ticket has a patch, it needs to be reviewed by a second set of eyes.
After uploading a patch or submitting a pull request, be sure to update the
ticket metadata by setting the flags on the ticket to say "has patch",
"doesn't need tests", etc, so others can find it for review. Contributing
doesn't necessarily always mean writing a patch from scratch. Reviewing
existing patches is also a very helpful contribution. See
:doc:`/internals/contributing/triaging-tickets` for details.
