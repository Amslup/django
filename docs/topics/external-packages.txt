External packages
=================

Django ships with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common
problems. For easier maintenance and to trim the size of the codebase,
during the course of Django development a few of those applications
have been moved out to separate projects. A few examples follow.

Localflavor
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``localflavor`` app, a collection of utilities for particular
countries or cultures, was removed from Django in 1.6. The new package
is named ``django-localflavor`` and the official documentation can be
found at https://django-localflavor.readthedocs.org/.

Comments
~~~~~~~~

Django's comment framework has been dropped in Django 1.8. Most users
will be better served with a custom solution, or a hosted product like
Disqus. The code formerly known as ``django.contrib.comments`` is
still available in an external repository. Official documentation
available at http://django-contrib-comments.readthedocs.org/.

Formtools
~~~~~~~~~

The ``formtools`` app, a collection of assorted utilities to work with
forms, was removed from Django in 1.8. The new package is named
``django-formtools`` and the official documentation can be found at
http://django-formtools.readthedocs.org/.

How to migrate
==============

If you've used any of the above packages, follow these two easy steps
to update your code:

1. Install the third-party package from PyPI, eg
``django-localflavor`` or ``django-contrib-comments``.

2. Change your app's import statements to reference the new package.

   For example, in the case of the localflavor app, change this::

       from django.contrib.localflavor.fr.forms import FRPhoneNumberField

   ...to this::

       from localflavor.fr.forms import FRPhoneNumberField

Please, refer to the external project documentation to get up to speed
with possible recent changes.
