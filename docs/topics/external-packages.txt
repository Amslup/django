External packages
=================

Django ships with a variety of extra, optional tools that solve common
problems. For easier maintenance and to trim the size of the codebase,
during the course of Django development a few of those applications
have been moved out to separate projects. A few examples follow.

Localflavor
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``localflavor`` app, a collection of utilities for particular
countries or cultures, was removed from Django in 1.6. The new package
is named `django-localflavor
<https://github.com/django/django-localflavor>`_ and the documentation
can be found `here <https://django-localflavor.readthedocs.org/>`__.

Comments
~~~~~~~~

Django's comment framework has been dropped in Django 1.8. Most users
will be better served with a custom solution, or a hosted product like
Disqus. The code formerly known as ``django.contrib.comments`` is
still available in an external `repository
<https://github.com/django/django-contrib-comments>`_. The
documentation is available `here
<http://django-contrib-comments.readthedocs.org/>`__.

Formtools
~~~~~~~~~

The ``formtools`` app, a collection of assorted utilities to work with
forms, was removed from Django in 1.8. The new package is named
`django-formtools <https://github.com/django/django-formtools>`_ and
the documentation can be found `here
<http://django-formtools.readthedocs.org/>`__.
