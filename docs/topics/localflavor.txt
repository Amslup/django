==========================
The "local flavor" add-ons
==========================

Historically, Django has shipped with ``django.contrib.localflavor`` --
assorted pieces of code that are useful for particular countries or cultures.
This code is now distributed separately from Django, for easier maintenance
and to trim the size of Django's codebase.

See the official documentation for more information:

How to migrate
==============

If you've used the old ``django.contrib.localflavor`` package or one of the
temporary ``django-localflavor-*`` releases, follow these two easy steps to
update your code:

1. Install the third-party ``django-localflavor`` package from PyPI.

2. Change your app's import statements to reference the new package.

   For example, change this::

       from django.contrib.localflavor.fr.forms import FRPhoneNumberField

   ...to this::

       from localflavor.fr.forms import FRPhoneNumberField

The code in the new package is the same (it was copied directly from Django),
so you don't have to worry about backwards compatibility in terms of
functionality. Only the imports have changed.
