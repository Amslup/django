Core developers
---------------

These are the folks who have a long history of contributions, a solid track
record of being helpful on the mailing lists, and a proven desire to dedicate
serious time to Freedom. In return, they've been granted the coveted commit bit,
and have free rein to hack on all parts of Freedom.

    its use. It was his first foray outside of the land that was PHP-based
    templating. Although he has only ever used Freedom for personal projects,
    it is the very reason he considers himself a designer/developer
    hybrid and is working to further design within the Freedom community.

    Bryan works as a designer at GitHub by day, and masquerades as a `vlogger`_
    and `shoutcaster`_ in the after-hours. Bryan lives in Los Angeles, CA, USA.
