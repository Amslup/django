Contributing to Django
======================

If you think working *with* Django is fun, wait until you start working *on*
it. Django is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to build Django. As a Django developer,
you can contribute in many ways.

Browse the following sections to find out how:

Here are some other ways you can help the Django community and others to build
a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the `Django forum`_. This forum is a place for discussing the Django
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Django.

* Join the |django-users| mailing list and answer questions. This
  mailing list has a huge audience, and we really want to maintain a
  friendly and helpful atmosphere. If you're new to the Django community,
  you should read the `posting guidelines`_.

* Join the `#django IRC channel`_ on Freenode and answer questions. By
  explaining Django to other users, you're going to learn a lot about the
  framework yourself.

* Blog about Django. We syndicate all the Django blogs we know about on
  the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
  can `register it here`_.

* Contribute to open-source Django projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Django, help us
  build it!
