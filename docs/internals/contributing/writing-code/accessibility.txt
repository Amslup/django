Accessibility
=============

The Django project is committed to being accessible to everyone in all possible ways.
We work to conform to established accessibility standards, and also to meet our own targets for supporting specific input devices and assistive technologies.

.. _accessibility-standards:

Accessibility standards
=======================

Django aims for conformance with the `Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), version 2.2`_, at the AA level.
WCAG is the most established standard for web accessibility. AA-level
guidelines are the most common legal compliance target worldwide.

We also attempt to follow other best practices, such as:

* WCAG 2.2 AAA-level guidelines.
* The upcoming `WCAG 3.0`_ guidelines.
* `Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0`_  â€“ guidelines for software and services that are used to produce web content.

.. note::
    Do you want to learn more about accessibility without diving straight into
    standards? We recommend `The A11Y Project`_,
    a community-driven effort to make digital accessibility easier.

Accessibility support targets
=============================

Beyond standards, we want to make sure Django actually works for people using
a wide range of input devices and assistive technologies.
The best way to do this effectively is to take accessibility considerations
into account as part of designing features. If in doubt, consult
with users who rely on assistive technologies or with accessibility experts.

.. _accessibility-testing-baseline:

Accessibility testing baseline
------------------------------

Always test user interface changes with:

* Keyboard-only navigation
* The `Accessibility Insights`_ browser extension's automated checks feature,
  or an equivalent tool with the `Axe`_ checker.

Where appropriate, also test with:

* Touch-only navigation
* 400% browser zoom
* Forced-colors mode (e.g., Windows Contrast Themes)
  * `Can be emulated with Chrome/Edge dev tools`_
  
.. _Can be emulated with Chrome/Edge dev tools: https://devtoolstips.org/tips/en/emulate-forced-colors/

.. note::
    How much should you test? Devise the UI with accessibility in mind,
    and the testing will only be needed as a final check. For more complex
    interfaces, confer with other contributors to decide on testing targets.

.. _assistive-technologies:

Assistive technologies
----------------------

Where more extensive testing is appropriate,
here are free assistive technologies we recommend testing with:

* `NVDA`_ on Windows with Firefox ESR
* `VoiceOver`_ on macOS with Safari
* `Narrator`_ on Windows with Microsoft Edge
* Windows Magnifier and macOS Zoom
* Windows Speech Recognition and macOS Voice Control
* VoiceOver on iOS, or TalkBack on Android
* `Contrast themes`_ on Windows

Where expert help is available, also consider testing with:

* `JAWS`_ on Windows
* `Dragon`_ on Windows

Known issues and how to help
============================

There are some parts of Django that do not meet our accessibility targets at the moment.
We actively work on fixing issues, both as part of ongoing maintenance
and bigger overhauls. To learn about known issues, and get involved, see:

* ``#accessibility`` on the `Django Discord server`_.
* `Accessibility issues on the ticket tracker`_.
* Our `django accessibility improvements`_ project board.
* The `Accessibility team`_.
