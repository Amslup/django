==========
JavaScript
==========

While most of Django core is Python, the ``admin`` and ``gis`` contrib apps
contain JavaScript code.

Please follow these coding standards when writing JavaScript code for inclusion
in Django.

Code style
----------

* Please conform to the indentation style dictated in the ``.editorconfig``
  file. We recommend using a text editor with `EditorConfig`_ support to avoid
  indentation and whitespace issues. Most of the JavaScript files use 4 spaces
  for indentation, but there are some exceptions

* When naming variables, use ``camelCase`` instead of ``underscore_case``.
  Different JavaScript files sometimes use a different code style. Please try to
  conform to the code style of each file.

* Use the `JSHint`_ code linter to check your code for bugs and style errors.
  JSHint will be run when you run the JavaScript tests. We also recommended
  installing a JSHint plugin in your text editor.
