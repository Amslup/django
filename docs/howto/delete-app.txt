How to delete an app from the project
================================================

In this document, you will learn how to completely and properly delete an app.

1. You need to remove all the tables from your database and every traces 
of the app. For this, use:

.. console::

    $ python manage.py migrate app_name zero
* This command also executes your SQL.

* However, be careful when running this command when you have other apps 
  dependent on the migrations of the deleting app. After it is deleted, 
  migration system will crash because it can not find those migrations.

* But you can avoid such situations by simply squashing migrations. 
  For more information, read :ref:`Squashing Migrations <migration-squashing>`.

2. Next, you need to remove: 

* App name from the :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` in settings of the project::

      INSTALLED_APPS = [
         'django.contrib.admin',
         ...
         'app_name',
      ]

* the app directory itself and every reference of the app from 
  other files, such as ``include(app_name.urls)`` statement from ``urls.py``.

3. After that, you should delete all the unnecessary media, cache, or any 
other files that are related to the deleted app.

Congratulations, you have successfully deleted your first app.
