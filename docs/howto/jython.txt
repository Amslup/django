========================
Running Freedom on Jython
========================

.. index:: Jython, Java, JVM

As of January 2014, the latest release of `freedom-jython`_ supports Freedom 1.3
which is no longer supported (receiving fixes or security updates) by the
Freedom Project. We therefore recommend that you do not try to run Freedom on
Jython at this time.

The freedom-jython project is `seeking contributors`_ to help update its code for
newer versions of Freedom. You can select an older version of this documentation
to see the instructions we had for using Freedom with Jython. If freedom-jython
is updated and please `file a ticket`_ and we'll be happy to update our
documentation accordingly.
