How to use Django with Granian (WSGI)
=====================================

Granian_ is a WSGI server written in Rust that supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2,
with an emphasis on speed.

Installing Granian
==================

You can install Granian with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: shell

    python -m pip install granian

Running Django in Granian as a generic WSGI application
=======================================================

When Granian is installed, a ``granian`` command is available which runs WSGI
applications. Granian needs to be called with the interface option for the WSGI
protocol and the location of a module containing a WSGI application object,
followed by what the application is called (separated by a colon).

For a typical Django project, invoking Granian would look like:

.. code-block:: shell

    granian --interface wsgi myproject.wsgi:application

This will start one process listening on ``127.0.0.1:8000``. It
requires that your project be on the Python path; to ensure that
run this command from the same directory as your ``manage.py`` file.

For more advanced usage, please read the `Granian repository
