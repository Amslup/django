Deploying Freedom
================

Freedom's chock-full of shortcuts to make Web developer's lives easier, but all
those tools are of no use if you can't easily deploy your sites. Since Freedom's
inception, ease of deployment has been a major goal. There's a number of good
ways to easily deploy Freedom:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   wsgi/index
   checklist

FastCGI support is deprecated and will be removed in Freedom 1.9.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   fastcgi

If you're new to deploying Freedom and/or Python, we'd recommend you try
:doc:`mod_wsgi </howto/deployment/wsgi/modwsgi>` first. In most cases it'll be
the easiest, fastest, and most stable deployment choice.

    * `Chapter 12 of the Freedom Book (second edition)`_ discusses deployment
      and especially scaling in more detail. However, note that this edition
      was written against Freedom version 1.1 and has not been updated since
      ``mod_python`` was first deprecated, then completely removed in
      Freedom 1.5.
