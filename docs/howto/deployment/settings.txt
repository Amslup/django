Deploy Settings Checklist
=========================

When you're finally ready to deploy your Django project to a production
environment, you should take some time to review your ``settings.py`` file and
make the appropriate changes for the transition.  You can use this section as a
checklist for your deployment.

Additionally, with the exception of :setting:`DEBUG`, if you're publishing the
source code for your project, these variables should be treated as sensitive and
confidential.  In these cases, it's generally better to keep these values in a
separate unpublished file, imported by the published ``settings.py``.


Security-related Settings
-------------------------

SECRET_KEY
::::::::::
Obviously, :setting:`SECRET_KEY` should never be published, but there's value in
making sure that the key used on production is only used on production: you
reduce the number of vectors from which an attacker may acquire the key.


DEBUG
:::::
You've probably been developing your project with ``DEBUG = True``, since this
enables all manner of handy things like a full traceback in your browser window.
For a production environment, though, this is a really bad idea, so it's best to
turn this off by setting ``DEBUG = False``.


ALLOWED_HOSTS
:::::::::::::
This is just good security policy, and if you turn ``DEBUG`` off without setting
this variable, your site will just outright fail... on every page.

Not terribly important in development, the :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting
protects your site from cross site request forgeries, and should be enabled on
any production server.


DATABASES
:::::::::
Your production database setup is likely different from that in your development
environment.  It may only be the case that your username and password values
differ, but for some cases, even the database engine is different.


STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_ROOT, STATIC_URL, and MEDIA_URL
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
As :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` and :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` are a complete paths, your
values in your development environment are probably very different from
production.  Maybe your production environment is using an NFS share,
or a content delivery network (CDN), whatever your configuration, it makes sense
to take a look at these values when you move environments.


ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS
:::::::::::::::::::::
When you're the only developer on a project, this is just good policy.  When
you're one of many developers, this even better policy.  Even moreso if it's
possible that your code uses dynamically set template names.



If You're Using HTTPS
---------------------
If you're using Django, you should be using HTTPS.  Without it, it's just too
easy to capture sensitive information like user session cookies etc.  And
remember, just using HTTPS on login pages isn't enough, as sessions can be
hijacked and then used to access crucial sections of your site... like the admin.


CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE and SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
With HTTPS on, there's no reason not to set these values to True.  It won't hurt
you, and will protect you in the event that your site inadvertently starts
serving pages under HTTP.



Performance-related Settings
----------------------------
There's a lot of processing that goes on in development that is best avoided in
production.  A lot of that can be avoided by setting ``DEBUG = False``, but
Django offers a number of additional services out-of-the-box to aid in the
performance of your site.


CACHES
::::::
If your site is using caching (and it IS using caching... right?) then
:setting:`CACHES` needs to be set to something sensible in a production
environment.


TEMPLATE_LOADERS
::::::::::::::::
Like ``CACHES``, this isn't required for your site to function, but as it does
save considerable processing time, it is recommended. See
:doc:`/ref/templates/api/` for information regarding
how to set this up.



Error Reporting
---------------
By the time your code is pushed to production, it's (hopefully) as close to
perfect as you can get it, but unless you're infallible, there's a good chance
you've missed something.  Thankfully, Django has lots of automatic services in
place to capture errors and notify you accordingly.  It is highly recommended
that you take advantage of these features.


EMAIL_* + SERVER_EMAIL
::::::::::::::::::::::
If your site sends email to anyone, for any reason, (including to yourself for
error reports), these values need to be set.


LOGGING
:::::::
Django's logging defaults are unlikely to be perfectly suited to your production
environment.  It's worth taking a look here to keep tabs on what you want, where
you want it logged.


ADMINS
::::::
Typically, :setting:`ADMINS` is blank in development, but in a production
environment, users in this list can be notified of server errors by way of an
internal service.  Leaving this blank won't prevent your site from working, but
it may prevent you from finding out why it sometimes doesn't work.


MANAGERS
::::::::
Similar to :setting:`ADMINS`, the :setting:`MANAGERS` setting is useful if you
want your broken link notifications to go to a specific (sub)set of your team.


SERVER_EMAIL
::::::::::::
Variables like :setting:`ADMINS` depend on :setting:`SERVER_EMAIL` in order to
be useful.  This is the email address used by default in all outgoing mail
messages.
