How to install Django on Windows
================================

This document will guide you through installing Python 3.5 and Django on Windows.
It also provides optional instructions for installing virtualenv and 
virtualenvwrapper, which handle many issues which crop up with pathing on Windows. 
This is meant as a beginner's guide for users working on Django projects and does 
not reflect how Django should be installed when developing patches for Django 
itself.

The steps in this guide have been tested with Windows 7, 8, and 10. In other
versions, the steps would be similar. You will need to be familiar with using the
Windows command prompt.

Install Python
==============

Django is a Python web framework, thus requiring Python to be installed on your
machine. At the time of writing, Python 3.5 is the latest version.

To install Python on your machine go to https://python.org/downloads/. The web
site should detect that you're on Windows, and offer you a download button for
the latest Python version. Download the executable installer and run it.

We recommend checking ``Add Python 3.5 to PATH``, and then clicking ``Install
Now`` to include IDLE, pip and documentation.

After installation, open the command prompt and check the Python version 
matches the version you installed by executing ``python --version``.

About pip
=========

``pip`` is a package manage for Python. It makes installing and uninstall Python
packages (such as Django!) very easy. For the rest of the installation, we will
use ``pip`` to install Python packages from the command line.

Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper (optional)
===================================================

``virtualenv`` and ``virtualenvwrapper`` provide a dedicated environment for each
Django Project you create. While not mandatory, this is considered a best
practice and will save you time in the future when you're ready to deploy your
project. Simply type::

    pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

Then create a virtualenv for your project::

    mkvirtualenv myproject

Install Django
==============

Django can be installed easily using ``pip``.

In the command prompt, execute the following command::

    pip install django

This will download and install the latest Django release.

After the installation has completed, you can verify your Django installation
by executing ``django-admin --version`` in the command prompt.

See :ref:`database-installation` for information on database installation
with Django.

Common pitfalls
===============

* If ``django-admin`` only displays the help text no matter what arguments
  it is given, there is probably a problem with the file association in
  Windows. Check if there is more than one environment variable set for
  running Python scripts in ``PATH``. This usually occurs when there is more
  than one Python version installed.

* If you are connecting to the internet behind a proxy, there might be problem
  in running the command ``pip install django``. Set the environment variables
  for proxy configuration in the command prompt as follows::

    set http_proxy=http://username:password@proxyserver:proxyport
    set https_proxy=https://username:password@proxyserver:proxyport
