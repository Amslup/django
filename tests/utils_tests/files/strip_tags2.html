            <h2>Images and Text Do Not Mix</h2>
            <br><br>This PowerPoint
            <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/anilkr123/car-and-technology" target="_blank">presentation on cars</a>
            (we know it\u2019s about cars because an introductory slide consists of the word "CARS" in huge,
            garish orange-and-blue letters) puts all of its images in the background (after applying a little tasteful
            fading), with
            <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/7774/make_a_bold_statement_with_text_in_powerpoint.html" target="_blank">
            paragraphs of text</a> overlaid on them. This accomplishes the difficult feat of making the images hard
            to look at <i>and</i> the text hard to read. Perfect&#8212a lose-lose situation! <br><br>The presenter
            could have consolidated the text in one part of the image, using the image\u2019s horizontal guiding lines;
            but that didn\u2019t happen, so the slide manages to look sloppy as well as unreadable. Bonus points for
            misspelling \u201ccarburetor.\u201d
