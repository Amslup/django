"""
To provide a shim layer over Pillow/PIL situation until the PIL support is
removed.


Combinations to account for:

* Pillow:
  * never has ``_imaging`` under any Python
  * has the ``Image.alpha_composite``, which may aid in detection
* PIL
  * CPython 2.x may have _imaging (& work)
  * CPython 2.x may *NOT* have _imaging (broken & needs a error message)
  * CPython 3.x doesn't work
  * PyPy will *NOT* have _imaging (but works?)

Restated, that looks like:

* Python 2.x
  * ``_imaging`` *NOT* present
    * ``Image.alpha_composite`` present - Pillow & working
    * ``Image.alpha_composite`` *NOT* present - PIL & broken
  * ``_imaging`` present
    * PIL & working
* Python 3.x
  * ``Image`` present - Pillow & working
* PyPy
  * ``_imaging`` *NOT* present - either Pillow or PIL (& working?)

Approach:

* Attempt to import ``Image``
  * ``ImportError`` - nothing is installed, toss an exception
  * Either Pillow or the PIL is installed, so continue detecting
* Attempt to ``hasattr(Image, 'alpha_composite')``
  * If it works, it's Pillow & working
  * If it fails, we've got a PIL install, continue detecting
    * The only option here is that we're on Python 2.x or PyPy, of which
      we only care about if we're on CPython.
    * If we're on CPython, attempt to ``import _imaging``
      * ``ImportError`` - Bad install, toss an exception
