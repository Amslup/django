    Middleware that stores the view's positional and named arguments in the

    standard.
    
    This implementation is not complete because we would have to move
    a part of PATH_INFO to SCRIPT_NAME, which would break backwards
    compatibility. It's also incomplete because `Django does not
    support mixing positional and named arguments
