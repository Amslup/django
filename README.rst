Docs Reading Guide
===========================

The Django documentation can be found both in the ``docs`` directory and online at `docs.djangoproject.com <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/>`_. To get started with Django, we suggest following these steps:

* Begin by reading the installation instructions in ``docs/intro/install.txt`` to learn how to install Django.

* Once Django is installed, we recommend working through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``, ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).

* If you're interested in deploying your Django application, refer to ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions on setting up a deployment server.

* To explore specific topics related to Django, take a look at the topical guides located in ``docs/topics``. If you encounter a specific problem, you can then refer to the HOWTOs located in ``docs/howto`` for solutions. If you want to dive deeper into Django's technical details, check out the reference located in ``docs/ref``.

* Finally, if you prefer a locally built version of the documentation, refer to ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.

Contributing
====================================

The open source Django project thrives on the support of its dedicated volunteers.

To learn more about how you can contribute to Django, please visit the  `Contributing <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/>`_ to Django page.

The work on Django falls into three major categories:

**1. Writing Code üíª**
    
   You can fix a bug or add a new feature to Django. By making a pull request, you'll see your code in the upcoming version of Django!
   
   Start from the `Writing code <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/>`_ docs.

**2. Writing Documentation ‚úçÔ∏è**
    
   Django‚Äôs documentation is one of its major strengths, and it's essential to keep it informative and comprehensive. You can help enhance and             update the documentation as the framework evolves.
   
   See `Writing documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-documentation/>`_  for more.

**3. Localizing Django üó∫Ô∏è**
    
   Django has been translated into more than 100 languages, including some surprising ones like Klingon! The i18n team is always looking for               translators to help maintain and increase language reach.
   
   See `Localizing Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/localizing/>`_ to help translate Django.
