Django
======

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design. It is a Python-based 
free and open-source web framework that follows the model–template–views 
architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, 
an American independent organization established as a 501 non-profit.

Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web 
development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent 
the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, 
great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support. 

Django helps you write software that is:

- Complete
- Versatile
- Secure
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Portable

Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the "``docs``" directory and online at
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,
here's how we recommend you read the docs:

* First, read ``docs/intro/install.txt`` for instructions on installing Django.

* Next, work through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``,
  ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).

* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read
  ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions.

* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in ``docs/topics``)
  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in ``docs/howto``) for specific
  problems, and check out the reference (``docs/ref``) for gory details.

* See ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think
they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a
ticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket
