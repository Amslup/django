  {% block p-blurb %}
    In 2015, Revinate's application and brand had gone through a redesign, so we knew that we had to up the game on our email strategy to customers as well. This involved improving emails from the application, marketing, and as well as communications from the Training + Support team.

                Our email strategy included our first contact with most of our customers. Our application and corporate website had grown and evolved over the years, but our emails had not, and we fixed that.

                I advocated for less text, more focus, and very obvious calls-to-actions in the new designs. Our previous emails were information-heavy, and the links did not stand out very much, or there would be many calls-to-action in one single email.

        		This project gave us the opportunity to rethink the entirety of our customer communication from the ground up. I started with taking inventory of the entirety of the emails we send out to customers. Throughout the years the teams lost track of what kinds of emails were being sent out and when across all the different departments, so having a list and document for everyone to refer to was helpful to understand the variety of all the different emails we sent in totality.

        		I began looking for repeated layout patterns in the emails. After sketching a few out, I identified rough building blocks such as 1-column, 2-column, 3-column layouts (and how that would translate on mobile); as well as individual elements that would need to be defined (i.e. H1 text, body text, CTAs, etc.).

        		I worked closely with Product and Support to determine what content we should keep and what content we could cut from the emails. Some emails had a lot of text (i.e. our email to invite users to create accounts, which is a critical email). I proposed a more focused email so users would not get distracted (or worse, lose interest and abandon the email).
