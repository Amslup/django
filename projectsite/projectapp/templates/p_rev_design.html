    Revinateâ€™s products lived on two sets of UI since they were developed separately. In late 2015 we decided to unify them onto one consolidated interface.

        		To move the older Reputation and Surveys products onto the new UI with our Marketing and Engage products, we had to update the navigation, sitemap, and consolidate UI patterns. The Marketing/Engage track had been developed without full design involvement, so this project was an opportunity to lay down basic color, page layout guidelines, and make patterns consistent in the new UI as well.
